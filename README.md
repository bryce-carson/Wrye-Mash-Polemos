# Experimental Xbox ESS support
- Saves in an Xbox folder structure should be supported, so a save folder
  transferred from your Xbox into your Morrowind saves can be inspected and
  repaired (such as resetting actors) before transferring back to the Xbox.
- Saves in the Xbox ESS format (e.g. "1.2", for a vanilla Morrowind.esm-only
  dependency, followed by 0x30) should be supported.
